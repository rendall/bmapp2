The piece creates space for participants to interact with the sculpture and each other. It contains many layers of interaction: viewing from afar, entering, playing the light field, and finally, using the light field as an instrument. The structure is made of triangular boxes of metal. On the interior-facing side, each box is outfitted with a laser cut back lit panel. The lights take input from simple buttons mounted in the center of various panels. With input, the panel alters the lighting scheme. Each press spreads effects and color across the surrounding panels, allowing for interplay between participants. Enunciation is a meditation on learning how to articulate oneself. The sculpture's primary function is to create an instrument for shared interaction, which offers more articulation with increased input of people and their time. Enunciation offers a strange way to communicate, but with practice, much can be articulated without speaking.","artist":null,"category":"Open Playa","program":"Honorarium","donation_link":null,"guided_tours":0,"self_guided_tour_map":0,"location":{"string":"11:22 3200', Open Playa","hour":11,"minute":22,"distance":3200,"category":"Open Playa","gps_latitude":40.7942819,"gps_longitude":-119.2014453},"location_string":"11:22 3200', Open Playa","images":[{"gallery_ref":0,"thumbnail_url":"https://embed.widencdn.net/img/burningman/b5xzlitfq1/640px/a2Id0000000cbSDEAY-Final.jpeg?keep=c&crop=yes&u=r3rtjx"}]},{"uid":"a2Id0000000cbP5EAI","year":2016,"name":"Octavius","url":null,"contact_email":"peter@peterhazel.com","hometown":"Verdi, NV","description":"Octavius is a giant octopus covered in a bright mosaic of hand-cut ceramic tiles in shades of orange, blue, and purple.

Society teaches us that the responsibility of our happiness lies on the shoulders of others. We spend so much time looking for happiness - love - everywhere but the one place we'll find it: within ourselves.\r\nAscension conveys a new definition of love: when separate, whole individuals form a partnership that reinforces their individuality while creating a unit where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Each person is growing as a whole individual first and foremost. The partnership reinforces this while bringing them both to a higher level, together. Through this symbolism, Ascension creates a space that inspires people to reflect on self love, loving others, and love as it relates to their world at large.","artist":null,"category":"Open Playa","program":"Self-Funded","donation_link":null,"guided_tours":0,"self_guided_tour_map":0,"location":{"string":"8:50 1400', Open Playa","hour":8,"minute":50,"distance":1400,"category":"Open Playa","gps_latitude":40.7888586,"gps_longitude":-119.2103843},"location_string":"8:50 1400', Open Playa","images":[{"gallery_ref":0,"thumbnail_url":"https://embed.widencdn.net/img/burningman/kudn05ccre/640px/a2Id0000000cbWqEAI-Final.jpeg?keep=c&crop=yes&u=r3rtjx"}]},{"uid":"a2Id0000000dOEiEAM","year":2016,"name":"DISC-GO-SPHERE","url":null,"contact_email":"matthew@commonkinetics.com","hometown":"New York, NY","description":"The DISC-GO-SPHERE, by artist/engineer Matthew Davis, is an interactive kinetic sculpture that gives participants the experience of being inside a 3 dimensional moving version of Da Vinci's \"Vitruvian Man\" sketch.

The emergence of the nose-section of a zero-emissions vehicle turns the image of Cadillac Ranch on its head.

The space is broken up into 3 areas. In the front you have a present day work area where modern workshops will be taught, like LED helicopters, making a solar stove, Tesla cell phone chargers, etc. If you want to tap into ancient technology, you can pass through the time portal into a workshop from the Renaissance era. The time portal will have an interactive clue aspect that you have to figure out in order to get the past to open up to you.\nThe front of the booth is heavy canvas walls painted to look like an ancient building with LED lit columns standing in front. The side project, the Da Vinci Code Capade, will involve picking up a cypher card in front of the booth and figuring out clues to take you around the playa. This will allow many of the Colorado theme camps to host our adventurers along the way.

The average stay of a refugee in a camp is 17 years. Since WWII the hosting and management of a refugee community in such camps has not changed. Till the day of today refugee camps are harsh survival environments where people risk exploitation, are hopeless and rules of the strongest apply. \r\n\r\nAfter being involved in the epicenter of the refugee crisis on the Greek island of Lesvos I came to the knowledge that there is such a big difference to be made in this global issue if we would stop seeing refugees, victims of injustice. Instead we should approach them as individuals with talents, opportunities equal to our own standards and with the same needs. We should be aware that if we would invest in people that have lost everything this investment will be returned to us in gratefulness and willingness to contribute in their own succes. You get what you give...\r\n\r\nIn creating communities that thrive you should start with environments that inspire. On Lesbos, the epicenter of the refugee crisis in Europe last year, I witnessed the similarities in dynamics between hosting refugees on a refugee camp and hosting a crowd on a music festival. We believe many insights from the festival industry can be integrated to redefine a refugee camp from a Spartan fashionlike environment to an inspiring festivallike experience.\r\n\r\nAdding to the festival game innovative solutions/companies, educational programs and integration of the refugee community in the management and self-sustainability of their camp will create an environment of harmony and dignity that will be an example in how to change a global issue into an opportunity that can serve humanity on a global scale. \r\n\r\nJoin me in this quest to redefine the global concept of a refugee camp to a campUS.","event_type":{"id":3,"label":"Class/Workshop","abbr":"work"},"year":2016,"print_description":"The outdated global model of a refugee camp needs to change from a Spartan fashion like to a festival fashion like environment.","slug":"camp-to-campus","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000001IX73EAG","located_at_art":null,"other_location":"Healing Dome","check_location":0,"url":"","all_day":0,"occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-09-03T14:30:00-07:00","end_time":"2016-09-03T16:00:00-07:00"}]},{"event_id":17772,"title":"Sunset Breakfast","uid":"idyDunSVREmvdCZG9rtA","description":"What’s better than pancakes and bacon?

We work with 12 pinhole cameras, created out of 50-gallon cardboard barrels. This size is uniquely suited for capturing the incredible scale and immense diversity of art and culture at Black Rock City. Under the red safelights of the darkroom, photosensitive paper is inserted into the camera body. Exposures range from 40 to 300 seconds, where concentrated beams of sunlight are funnelled through the pinhole and into the camera, creating a negative image of the recorded subject. We maintain a desert darkroom in a shipping container, where we gather to processes, develop and fix about one hundred photographs each Burning Man. These unique images are then exhibited in Illumination Village, Center Camp Cafe, and off-playa. The pinhole camp has been creating large-scale portraits with festival participants since 1999.","event_type":{"id":3,"label":"Class/Workshop","abbr":"work"},"year":2016,"print_description":"Come play with us, we do pinhole photography on the playa!","slug":"pinhole-camera-photography-with-pinhole-project","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000001IWFOEA4","located_at_art":null,"other_location":"","check_location":0,"url":"http://www.pinholeproject.org","all_day":0,"contact":"cawhelan@att.net","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-08-29T10:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2016-08-29T12:00:00-07:00"}]},{"event_id":17930,"title":"BDSM Tastings","uid":"LnBcDR53EbFnMcpQwY6N","description":"If you’re curious about BDSM, our experienced tops will be giving a variety of short BDSM tastings.

This year, in name of \"Radical Self Expression\" we sent out five hundred vinyl toy elephants to kids all over the world and asked them to express themselves by decorating them.  We are then taking those elephants and displaying them at Burning Man under The Man as part of the Guild Workshops piazza.\r\nOur aim is to bring awareness of the importance of creativity in a child's life. Lack of funding has stopped art programs in many public schools across the country. We are figuratively and literally putting the crayon back in the child's hand. We are also bringing 10,000 elephants to the playa this year and letting burners express themselves by decorating the elephants, and gifting them to fellow burners. \r\nWe chose to create a vinyl elephant for the kids to decorate because of the elephant's outstanding memory. We are building positive experiences in children that we want them to remember for a lifetime. \r\nWe also sculpted the elephant into the shape of the Vitruvian Man, as a wink to this year's Burning Man theme.","event_type":{"id":3,"label":"Class/Workshop","abbr":"work"},"year":2016,"print_description":"Radical Self Expression, 10,000 Elephants to decorate, gift, take home and get creative with.

When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience. Your specific needs and desires will be discussed at the beginning, and the experience will be fine-tuned to give you exactly what you want. No penetration is involved, but sexy talk and sensual touch are available options. We want everyone to feel refreshed and respected when they leave. We are strongly focused on cleanliness and health, along with fun. Come solo, or bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. Wear as much or as little as you would like, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, 18+, the Orgasamator Experience is something you won't want to miss. Lines are shortest early in the week, and early in the day.","event_type":{"id":6,"label":"Adult-oriented","abbr":"adlt"},"year":2016,"print_description":"The Orgasamator offers intense physical pleasure in an environment that's safe, comfortable, sensual & private.

For the first time ever, Burning Man is hosting a series of workshops in a Florentine piazza-style format to have Masters of various craftsmanship skills teach our students the arts of the Renaissance. \r\n\r\nWe, The Three Faced (Stone) Wench Workshop/Guild, are offering a series of classes you would love to attend! \r\n\r\nHere’s the scoop:\r\n\r\nApprentices will learn the various actual old time techniques over several days to create a fresco (block) from scratch to take home. As part of our commitment to up-cycle, we will utilize and recycle actual (old foam insulation) building materials. Participants will learn to recreate various historical stone mixtures that compromise the the surfaces of the block, complete with plastering, cartooning, and finally the stages of painting the actual fresco with pigments. This artifact creation will be followed by (and applied) techniques to 'age' their artwork with the patina and craquelure of passing time. The result? A beautiful, yet portable and tangible, aged piece of buon fresco that becomes their momento of inspired learning at Burning Man. ;)\r\n\r\nUpon completing your fresco block, you will receive a Playa Plastered Master of Arts certificate, authorizing you to be plastered anywhere on the playa!\r\n\r\nThat’s not all! \r\n\r\nWe are offering a unique community project/event, and we invite everyone to participate with your hearts (and energy): \r\n\r\nWe are accomplishing a recreation of Gustav Klimt’s Beethoven Frieze (Ode To Joy), with a slight twist on the theme: “All You Need Is Love.” The secco fresco artwork will stretch across several large panels, a moving tribute of the people lost at Orlando, Florida, and of our experiences at Burning Man. \r\n\r\nPlease join us! ;o)\r\n\r\nYouth ages 12 and up welcome.","event_type":{"id":3,"label":"Class/Workshop","abbr":"work"},"year":2016,"print_description":"A community project to create a secco fresco artwork stretching across several large panels, a moving tribute of the people lost at Orlando, Florida.","slug":"all-you-need-is-love","hosted_by_camp":null,"located_at_art":null,"other_location":"Guild Workshops -- At the Man","check_location":0,"url":"http://insanelycurious.com","all_day":0,"contact":"ritualsart@aol.com","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-08-29T09:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2016-08-29T17:00:00-07:00"},{"start_time":"2016-08-30T09:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2016-08-30T17:00:00-07:00"},{"start_time":"2016-08-31T09:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2016-08-31T17:00:00-07:00"},{"start_time":"2016-09-01T09:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2016-09-01T17:00:00-07:00"},{"start_time":"2016-09-02T09:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2016-09-02T17:00:00-07:00"}]},{"event_id":18311,"title":"Bootie BRC: Decadent Oasis","uid":"3gNVcEUa3eBD4xmBPhSi","description":"Bootie BRC: Decadent Oasis\r\nDecadent Oasis\r\n8pm-late\r\nOMG MUSIC WITH WORDS!

When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience. Your specific needs and desires will be discussed at the beginning, and the experience will be fine-tuned to give you exactly what you want. No penetration is involved, but sexy talk and sensual touch are available options. We want everyone to feel refreshed and respected when they leave. We are strongly focused on cleanliness and health, along with fun. Come solo, or bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. Wear as much or as little as you would like, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, 18+, the Orgasamator Experience is something you won't want to miss.

We work with 12 pinhole cameras, created out of 50-gallon cardboard barrels. This size is uniquely suited for capturing the incredible scale and immense diversity of art and culture at Black Rock City. Under the red safelights of the darkroom, photosensitive paper is inserted into the camera body. Exposures range from 40 to 300 seconds, where concentrated beams of sunlight are funnelled through the pinhole and into the camera, creating a negative image of the recorded subject. We maintain a desert darkroom in a shipping container, where we gather to processes, develop and fix about one hundred photographs each Burning Man. These unique images are then exhibited in Illumination Village, Center Camp Cafe, and off-playa. The pinhole camp has been creating large-scale portraits with festival participants since 1999.","event_type":{"id":3,"label":"Class/Workshop","abbr":"work"},"year":2016,"print_description":"Check out our pinhole cameras, do an art tour, and make art.

There is no wrong way to do this.\r\n \r\n Open the door to your body to express the unimaginable. \r\n \r\n In the experience, you will be guided through a passage in which you find your own way of moving the body. I don’t ask anyone to move their body in a rhythm, nor engage bodies, nor expect that all the people do the same action. People don’t need to follow a pattern or imitate; it’s experiential, there is no wrong way to do this. I give directions based on trust in the body, and what it can manifest. The person will discover how to adapt these directions to their understanding and needs. Maybe someone can move rapidly, maybe another can move slowly, or hardly at all — each one with their own development and course of action.\r\n \r\n This workshop focuses on the method of “The Unknown Theater” (El Teatro Desconocido) directed by Juan Carlos De Petre and developed over forty years by a group of people concentrated on exploration of subtle expression. The practice reveals knowledge; we start from the consciousness of not-knowing — ignorance is the beginning. This knowledge is experimental and creative; not intellectual, preconceived, acquired through repetition, or memory. Participants will work as a unique being, independent, and according to their own development. You can overcome intimidation and shame; discover empowerment, physical malleability, and grace.","event_type":{"id":3,"label":"Class/Workshop","abbr":"work"},"year":2016,"print_description":"Do you want to experience poetry of the body while hardly moving at all?

We work with 12 pinhole cameras, created out of 50-gallon cardboard barrels. This size is uniquely suited for capturing the incredible scale and immense diversity of art and culture at Black Rock City. Under the red safelights of the darkroom, photosensitive paper is inserted into the camera body. Exposures range from 40 to 300 seconds, where concentrated beams of sunlight are funnelled through the pinhole and into the camera, creating a negative image of the recorded subject. We maintain a desert darkroom in a shipping container, where we gather to processes, develop and fix about one hundred photographs each Burning Man.

As part of our commitment to up-cycle, we will utilize and recycle actual (old foam insulation) building materials. Participants will learn to recreate various historical stone mixtures that compromise the the surfaces of the block, complete with plastering, cartooning, and finally the stages of painting the actual fresco with pigments. This artifact creation will be followed by (and applied) techniques to 'age' their artwork with the patina and craquelure of passing time. The result? A beautiful, yet portable and tangible, aged piece of buon fresco that becomes their momento of inspired learning at Burning Man. ;)\r\n\r\nUpon completing your fresco block, you will receive a Playa Plastered Master of Arts certificate, authorizing you to be plastered anywhere on the playa!\r\n\r\nThat’s not all! \r\n\r\nWe are offering a unique community project/event, and we invite everyone to participate with your hearts (and energy): \r\n\r\nWe are accomplishing a recreation of Gustav Klimt’s Beethoven Frieze (Ode To Joy), with a slight twist on the theme: “All You Need Is Love.” The secco fresco artwork will stretch across several large panels, a moving tribute of the people lost at Orlando, Florida, and of our experiences at Burning Man. \r\n\r\nPlease join us! ;o)\r\n\r\nYouth ages 12 and up welcome.","event_type":{"id":3,"label":"Class/Workshop","abbr":"work"},"year":2016,"print_description":"Let’s get PLASTERED!

When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience. Your specific needs and desires will be discussed at the beginning, and the experience will be fine-tuned to give you exactly what you want. No penetration is involved, but sexy talk and sensual touch are available options. We want everyone to feel refreshed and respected when they leave. We are strongly focused on cleanliness and health, along with fun. Come solo, or bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. Wear as much or as little as you would like, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, 18+, the Orgasamator Experience is something you won't want to miss.

For the first time ever, Burning Man is hosting a series of workshops in a Florentine piazza-style format to have Masters of various craftsmanship skills teach our students the arts of the Renaissance. \r\n\r\nWe, The Three Faced (Stone) Wench Workshop/Guild, are offering a series of classes you would love to attend! \r\n\r\nHere’s the scoop:\r\n\r\nApprentices will learn the various actual old time techniques over several days to create a fresco (block) from scratch to take home. As part of our commitment to up-cycle, we will utilize and recycle actual (old foam insulation) building materials. Participants will learn to recreate various historical stone mixtures that compromise the the surfaces of the block, complete with plastering, cartooning, and finally the stages of painting the actual fresco with pigments. This artifact creation will be followed by (and applied) techniques to 'age' their artwork with the patina and craquelure of passing time. The result? A beautiful, yet portable and tangible, aged piece of buon fresco that becomes their momento of inspired learning at Burning Man. ;)\r\n\r\nUpon completing your fresco block, you will receive a Playa Plastered Master of Arts certificate, authorizing you to be plastered anywhere on the playa!\r\n\r\nThat’s not all! \r\n\r\nWe are offering a unique community project/event, and we invite everyone to participate with your hearts (and energy): \r\n\r\nWe are accomplishing a recreation of Gustav Klimt’s Beethoven Frieze (Ode To Joy), with a slight twist on the theme: “All You Need Is Love.” The secco fresco artwork will stretch across several large panels, a moving tribute of the people lost at Orlando, Florida, and of our experiences at Burning Man. \r\n\r\nPlease join us! ;o)\r\n\r\nYouth ages 12 and up welcome.","event_type":{"id":3,"label":"Class/Workshop","abbr":"work"},"year":2016,"print_description":"Let’s get PLASTERED!

When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience. Your specific needs and desires will be discussed at the beginning, and the experience will be fine-tuned to give you exactly what you want. No penetration is involved, but sexy talk and sensual touch are available options. We want everyone to feel refreshed and respected when they leave. We are strongly focused on cleanliness and health, along with fun. Come solo, or bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. Wear as much or as little as you would like, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, 18+, the Orgasamator Experience is something you won't want to miss.

We will use the intelligence of the movement to communicate. \r\n \r\n You can move being encouraged and guided by the intelligence of morphic fields (Rupert Sheldrake has published credible research about this). A morphic field is a field of energy that stores information; in the field exist dynamics, settings, games, processes; it is a memory field, it is an intelligent field. A morphic field is created when any of us introduces an intention and an action in space and time, which after being performed several times becomes a specific intelligence, then that intelligence influences the actions of a whole group and creates a memory of a way of doing things. We can create morphic fields at will, because our intelligence is able to. In a morphic field the communication is easy and instantaneous. What this workshop proposes is the creation of fields of intelligence through movement, because I believe that as human beings we are prepared to communicate with new languages. Art informs certain languages ​​that are developed over time, and perhaps now it's time to take those languages ​​as structures that allow us a different way to function in life.\r\n \r\n Morphic Field Movement becomes physical expression, borne from body languages, from the poetry of the body, from the clear expression of the bodies...","event_type":{"id":3,"label":"Class/Workshop","abbr":"work"},"year":2016,"print_description":"This practice is not dance, body expression, theater, nor performance — it is a composition of these, and more.","slug":"morphic-field-movement","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000001IV3SEAW","located_at_art":null,"other_location":"","check_location":0,"url":"","all_day":0,"occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-08-30T16:30:00-07:00","end_time":"2016-08-30T19:00:00-07:00"}]},{"event_id":18966,"title":"Naked Pub Crawl","uid":"qPD8UKQrnGZxHrT5cRR5","description":"Drink and be merry/naked.

Whether it is tickling to tears, to moans of delight, or simply squirming Kelli Lynn Sage (Domme Sage) is well versed in this and will be leading this class in sensual touch and the art of tickling with a partner. Domme Sage has learned the ropes over the years and wants to pass her wisdom on to you. She will instruct you, with the help of her assistants and volunteers, on the art of tickling and sensual touch. This event is for those 18 years old and over (please bring your ID if you look young). We may be requesting volunteers from the audience for some aspects of the class, so if you are eager to be part of this hands on experience let us know. People of all gender identities are welcome to attend. It is best if you can come with a partner so you can practice some of what you learn, if you come alone we cannot guarantee to partner you up with someone.

It is an open-eye meditation technique that focuses on the breath while also taking in your surroundings.

With practice, this technique helps one discover who they really are, not who they feel they are supposed to be. It has done wonders for me and truly changed my life.

Though gentle, relaxing, non-impactful movement sequences along with inspirational meditation, you will leave the day standing straighter and taller and with your shoulders falling back behind your chest, hence allowing you to lead with your heart as you walk forward into the world.\r\n \r\n Think of Feldenkrais as meditation with movement! \r\n \r\n If you are experiencing any pain, you might find it improve or resolve throughout the class. Feldenkrais helps with the realignment of our bones, muscles and joints and with the coordination of our overall movement patterns.\r\n \r\n As we radiate more love out into the world, the world can’t help but smile back.

When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience. Your specific needs and desires will be discussed at the beginning, and the experience will be fine-tuned to give you exactly what you want. No penetration is involved, but sexy talk and sensual touch are available options. We want everyone to feel refreshed and respected when they leave. We are strongly focused on cleanliness and health, along with fun. Come solo, or bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. Wear as much or as little as you would like, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, 18+, the Orgasamator Experience is something you won't want to miss.

Josie Posie leads a ceremony where the women of the playa welcome the men lovingly at the entrance to the dome, inviting them to match the high vibration they hold. The dome becomes an Ancient temple space. The men then stand in a circle offering unconditional love and healing to the community of women who gather in the center. The women come for healing their trust of the Masculine and to receive their love. This is a hands-off workshop. There is no touching except optional hugging at the end. \r\n\r\nWhen men show up and become the pure presence of their Divine Masculine nature and truly witness them, then women can relax into their loving Divine Feminine nature and fully become that love.

As our name implies (Playfully Yours), we focus on the lighter, softer, and more sensual side of BDSM. Our personnel are available to provide instructions and demonstrations on the safe use of the equipment and will supervise play or can help facilitate play.  We’ll also have an outdoor dungeon play area equipped with a double St Andrews Cross, spanking bench, and stock. We also have a lounge area where you can relax and meet our campmates if you are over 21 years old with id. The lounge has a spanking bike, a corn hole bean bag game, lounge chairs, a mini bar serving cherry bombs, and a spinning wheel to facilitate participation. In Mist’R Cool’s Camp you can have the Cool Mist Experience with a fully automated misting booth, try to put together oversized 3D and 2D puzzles, show off with a 10’ dance pole, and experience the Cool Massage with a new and advanced sensual massager.

For the first time ever, Burning Man is hosting a series of workshops in a Florentine piazza-style format to have Masters of various craftsmanship skills teach our students the arts of the Renaissance. \r\n\r\nWe, The Three Faced (Stone) Wench Workshop/Guild, are offering a series of classes you would love to attend! \r\n\r\nHere’s the scoop:\r\n\r\nApprentices will learn the various actual old time techniques over several days to create a fresco (block) from scratch to take home. As part of our commitment to up-cycle, we will utilize and recycle actual (old foam insulation) building materials. Participants will learn to recreate various historical stone mixtures that compromise the the surfaces of the block, complete with plastering, cartooning, and finally the stages of painting the actual fresco with pigments. This artifact creation will be followed by (and applied) techniques to 'age' their artwork with the patina and craquelure of passing time. The result? A beautiful, yet portable and tangible, aged piece of buon fresco that becomes their momento of inspired learning at Burning Man. ;)\r\n\r\nUpon completing your fresco block, you will receive a Playa Plastered Master of Arts certificate, authorizing you to be plastered anywhere on the playa!\r\n\r\nThat’s not all! \r\n\r\nWe are offering a unique community project/event, and we invite everyone to participate with your hearts (and energy): \r\n\r\nWe are accomplishing a recreation of Gustav Klimt’s Beethoven Frieze (Ode To Joy), with a slight twist on the theme: “All You Need Is Love.” The secco fresco artwork will stretch across several large panels, a moving tribute of the people lost at Orlando, Florida, and of our experiences at Burning Man. \r\n\r\nPlease join us! ;o)\r\n\r\nYouth ages 12 and up welcome.","event_type":{"id":3,"label":"Class/Workshop","abbr":"work"},"year":2016,"print_description":"Let’s get PLASTERED!

In contrast it stops working, and you tend to stare at yourself in mirrors. Then get self-critical all too often. Even if you are feeling wonderful, like all so many times at Burning Man, a mirror doesn't reflect it naturally, so you tend to lose that sparkle and start to question your good feelings.  \r\n\r\nIn contrast, when you look in one of these true reflection mirrors, your face keeps working!  Your eyes, which have so much beautiful information in them, continue to have that same information that you can see.  This is what we see and read so well when we look at you.  That sparkle when you are happy, that depth when you are being deep, that vitality and genuineness that we know about you, now you can see it too!  So easy to believe in yourself when you see all that true energy you have. \r\n\r\nThe result?  Expect to be absolutely floored.  You are an amazing creature - a Human Being, and now you can see what that really looks, and feels like.  The feedback loop you find yourself in now is clear and complete, so smiles look like real smiles and you will smile back.  Complete with sparkle!!!

Come learn how fear and our essential state of being work in a dynamic relationship to create our EGO (impulsive actions, and self-defeating beliefs and habits). In this workshop, we will touch on the basic understanding of fear and it's differentiation from Worry, Anxiety, and False Fear. Then dive deep into existentialism explaining why fear has such a programmable hold on our free will, and biology, causing our impulsive actions and thoughts. Then we will explore techniques I've used to transcend my own fears, self-defeating beliefs and habits, freeing myself from years of insecurity, blame, resentment, childhood abuse, guilt from molestation, and general self-hate. I will share every method that has worked for me, and then afterword we will have a Q&A, and have a fun conversation and share our experiences. \r\n\r\nAbout Me: Hello my name is Nine Johnson, I'm a Performance Anxiety coach in Los Angeles California.

The technique was originally billed as a spiritual-style practice like meditation, but as it gains popularity, it’s being presented as more of a “technological innovation” or “body-hack to happiness.” The “guru” of the technique, 46-year-old Nicole Daedone, guarantees that it’s profound whether you’re coupled or single.

It is time for feminine power and leadership to rise and join a healthy, incorruptible masculine. Where are the positive archetypes of feminine power? Kali, who cuts off your head? Hera, who is the god form of holly homemaker: basically “Zeus’ wife” with a goddess-sized jealous streak? Wonder Woman, who battles evil but has no family and no love in her life? It’s time for us to tell a new story of femininity, with our choices, with our self-expression, and with our lives. There are too few positive examples of women who are in full command of their sexuality and its attractive powers. There are too few healthy stories of women who’s full creative expression is unbridled and uncontrolled. There are too few healthy stories of men who are powerful without creating harm and violence .  There are too few healthy stories of men who create win-win instead of win-lose.  Learn how to harness the feminine forms and masculine forms of power in each of your interactions and become a true manifestor - brining your highest vision into reality through your being, your words, and your actions.You will learn an unforgettable map of your own sources of power, some of which have been lying dormant for your entire life. Once you can locate and allow all four faces of incorruptible power to move through you, you can lead, inspire, and serve almost anyone. For Men and Women who want to bring their full spiritual presence into the material world and be the bridge between our present reality and the future vision only you can see.","event_type":{"id":3,"label":"Class/Workshop","abbr":"work"},"year":2016,"print_description":"Learn how to harness the feminine forms and masculine forms of power in each of your interactions and become a true integrated leader, & serve anyone","slug":"leadership-the-four-faces-of-incorruptible-power","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000001IX73EAG","located_at_art":null,"other_location":"Mystic Theater","check_location":0,"url":"","all_day":0,"occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-08-31T14:30:00-07:00","end_time":"2016-08-31T16:30:00-07:00"}]},{"event_id":19841,"title":"Mad Sorcerer's Workshop","uid":"cYkhvFWYLJsK4WTVhcNP","description":"Do you like Burning Man?  Do you like shiny lights?  Do you like play-doh?  We thought so.  This year, the NY Regional is combining all three, for the ultimate Midway interactive art trifecta at Burning Man.  \r\n\r\nEach visitor to the Mad Sorcerer's Workshop creates one tiny clay creature and adds it to the world growing on the shelves of an infinity box.  Visitors are encouraged to interact with each other, to cooperate, and to let their imaginations roam, molding polka dot trees, green cows, castles, dinosaurs, and UFOs.  Make a blue fish, your friend can make a red bird, the next person will make a small man, together we'll have the beginnings of a whole new world, with the reflections of the infinity box making it look like there's whole schools and flocks of strange creatures and a crowd of people, all interacting.\r\n\r\nYou get to be the Mad Sorcerer, create whole worlds in your crystal ball, just to mess with them.  You get to say how creative and lovely your pet world will be.  There's no skill required, no creation too boring or too creative.  A red, and yellow and purple castle?  Yes!  A small brown snake?  Yes!  Every play-doh creature has a place with us.\r\n\r\nWant to see how the project is going?  Want to Contribute and Volunteer?

It is how the human race continues. \r\n \r\n And, we are more.\r\n \r\n This powerful energy can also be directed up and through the heart. And when it is, that force of energy has the power to soften the heart and break through walls we may have built up around it (fear, resentment, grudges, and other things that keep us from feeling our own Divinity). If the heart is open and cleansed, energy can move into that space. When it does, it creates a pleasure that makes sex seem rather mundane. The energy gets transmuted into spiritual power and ecstasy – Pure Love.\r\n \r\n In this workshop, we will use the power of yin and yang, platonic (non-sexual) touch and loving friendship to soften, expand and ignite the heart with Pure Love.\r\n \r\n Using the Light of our eyes and the Energy that moves through our hands and hearts we will connect with each other, swim in Love and glorify the Divinity within our hearts.\"","event_type":{"id":3,"label":"Class/Workshop","abbr":"work"},"year":2016,"print_description":"Use the power of platonic (non-sexual) touch to transmute sexual energy into spiritual power – Pure Love.","slug":"expansion-of-love-through-human-connection","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000001IV3SEAW","located_at_art":null,"other_location":"","check_location":0,"url":"","all_day":0,"occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-08-31T17:30:00-07:00","end_time":"2016-08-31T19:30:00-07:00"}]},{"event_id":20363,"title":"Sacristy: An Ecstatic Dance","uid":"5AY2wiAAo4HvEPXiEH3M","description":"The Second Annual Sacristy Ecstatic Dance, hosted by the Playa Choir's resident DJ.

This contact can actually induce the production of a pair bonding hormone, called oxytocin, in the human brain, similar to how you feel when you hug or kiss a loved one. \r\n\r\nThrough the sensation of touch and dance, you can explore organic movement generated through and with, one-another, forming new bonds and strengthening old ones.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by a variety of musicians, this session will begin with some simple guiding prompts to help individuals become familiar with touching as well as giving/receiving weight. As the jam progresses individuals get to explore movement by listening and responding to their partner/partners through touch. There are no right or wrong answers and you do not need prior dance training to participate. \r\n\r\nThe central characteristic of Contact Improvisation is a focus on bodily awareness and physical reflexes rather than consciously controlled movements.  Much like meditation, Contact Improvisational Dance seeks to honor the present moment by guiding the dancers to surrender what is happening now. \r\n\r\n“One learns to recognize and differentiate subtle impulses in our movement choices and our partner's choices. We begin to decipher the cues that we give and receive which tell us when to lead or follow, when to go up, when to go down, where to touch, how to lift, when to slow down, and when to be still. In this form one learns to stay in integrity with each choice, never forcing, never rushing.

The results of the jury cannot be protested. All performances are scored on a scale from 4.0 to 6.0 – 6.0 being the highest possible. Scores are given to one decimal point (e.g. 5.4, not 5.48). A single score is given to each air guitarist based on their overall performance in that round.\r\n\r\nThe score reflects the quality of the performance based on three key criteria:\r\n\r\n1.\tTechnical merit - You don’t have to know what notes you’re playing, but the more your invisible fretwork corresponds to the music that’s playing, the better the performance.\r\n2.\tStage presence - Anyone can do it in the privacy of their bedroom. Few have what it takes to rock a crowd of hundreds or even thousands – all without an instrument.\r\n3.\t“Airness” - The last criteria is the most difficult to define yet often the most decisive of all. Airness is defined as the extent to which a performance transcends the imitation of a real guitar and becomes an art form in and of itself.\r\n\r\nPlease note: the scores from BOTH ROUNDS are added to determine the contestants’ final scores. This combined score determines the winner.

At Recycle Camp we want all of your ALUMINUM cans as part of our gift to the playa. We are located at 6 and Center Circle behind the Center Camp Cafe and will be open every day until 5pm. No drop offs allowed, when you get there you will help us quickly separate your cans before riding the Crushinator, our magical bicycle-powered can crushing apparatus, to compact the cans so we can store as many as possible before scrapping the aluminum off-site. All of the money we generate from can recycling is donated to the Gerlach school system. We only accept aluminum cans so please keep all of your soup or heavy metal cans. If you are unsure if it is aluminum a good rule of thumb is if you can't crush it, then we don't want it. Also, some stout beers like Guinness also have a plastic widget that cannot be recycled with the aluminum, please remove of be conscious of it before bringing them to us. PROTIP from the Recyclenauts: bring a MESH bag to store all of your cans in. Plastic bags won't allow your cans to dry out, so please store them in a mesh bag before bringing them over to Recycle Camp and help make things a little less juicy for us when we crush them. Be smart, plan ahead, Recycle Camp wants YOU to come CRUSH it with us!!!

In cognitive psychology FOMO is known as loss aversion.  Loss aversion refers to people's tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains. Most studies suggest that losses are twice as powerful, psychologically, as gains.  Basically FOMO is the losing out on what others are currently experiencing and valuing it higher than the gain of your current experience.  An early example of FOMO comes from Tulipmania in Holland in the 1590s.  Seeing and hearing others buy into the promises of tulip profitability encouraged others to do the same. Nobody wanted to be the one missing out. \r\n\r\nWhen you lose something it hurts and often to avoid this negative emotion strange behavior may occur.

To be naked in 21st century western society demands intense self-examination, the questioning and reappraisal of conventional conventions and morality.

I don’t ask anyone to move their body in a rhythm, nor engage bodies, nor expect that all the people do the same action. People don’t need to follow a pattern or imitate; it’s experiential. \r\n　 　 \r\nI give directions based on trust in the body, and what it can manifest. The person will discover how to adapt these directions to their understanding and needs. Maybe someone can move rapidly, maybe another can move slowly, or hardly at all — each one with their own development and course of action. \r\n　 　 \r\nThis workshop focuses on the method of “The Unknown Theater” (El Teatro Desconocido) directed by Juan Carlos De Petre and developed over forty years by a group of people concentrated on exploration of subtle expression. \r\n　 　 \r\nThe practice reveals knowledge; we start from the consciousness of not-knowing — ignorance is the beginning. \r\n　 　 \r\nThis knowledge is experimental and creative; not intellectual, preconceived, acquired through repetition, or memory. Participants will work as a unique being, independent, and according to their own development. You can overcome intimidation and shame; discover empowerment, physical malleability, and grace.\r\n　 　 \r\nOpen the door to your body to express the unimaginable. \r\n 　　 \r\n#clothing optional #nudist #naturist","event_type":{"id":3,"label":"Class/Workshop","abbr":"work"},"year":2016,"print_description":"Do you want to experience poetry of the body while hardly moving at all?","slug":"contraexpression-poetry-of-the-body","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000001IV3SEAW","located_at_art":null,"other_location":"ANAHASANA VILLAGE 7:00 & E — PINWHEEL","check_location":0,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/911326792327246/","all_day":0,"occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-08-31T10:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2016-08-31T12:30:00-07:00"}]},{"event_id":21060,"title":"3rd Annual Fancy as Fuck Party","uid":"LqQwfsfCjXA4bE5QuumP","description":"Put on your most dapper burner attire and hang in the hookah lounge, get down on the dance floor, and imbibe our Shangri-Flawless cocktails.

We will use the intelligence of the movement to communicate. You can move being encouraged and guided by the intelligence of morphic fields (Rupert Sheldrake has published credible research about this). \r\n 　　 \r\nA morphic field is a field of energy that stores information; in the field exist dynamics, settings, games, processes; it is a memory field, it is an intelligent field. A morphic field is created when any of us introduces an intention and an action in space and time, which after being performed several times becomes a specific intelligence, then that intelligence influences the actions of a whole group and creates a memory of a way of doing things. In a morphic field the communication is easy and instantaneous. \r\n 　　 \r\nMorphic Field Movement becomes physical expression, borne from body languages, from the poetry of the body, from the clear expression of the bodies. \r\n 　　 \r\nWhat I would like to explore is the possibility to express more subtle dimensions of communication, more rare to our usual life; communicating realities that words can not name and the body can reveal. Morphic Field Movement is a proposal to create another type of communication — alternative now, and I hope definitive and more popular in the future.　　 #clothing optional #nudist #naturist","event_type":{"id":3,"label":"Class/Workshop","abbr":"work"},"year":2016,"print_description":"This practice is not dance, body expression, theater, nor performance — it is a composition of these, and more.","slug":"morphic-field-movement","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000001IV3SEAW","located_at_art":null,"other_location":"ANAHASANA VILLAGE 7:00 & E — PINWHEEL","check_location":0,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/533417720200941/","all_day":0,"occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-08-30T16:30:00-07:00","end_time":"2016-08-30T19:00:00-07:00"}]},{"event_id":21065,"title":"BRC Pride Parade","uid":"XaxRQLtBFCSAjemYD889","description":"Meet up at CampProper to start the annual 2016 Lesbian, Gay, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, Asexual, and Ally Pride Parade!

We will begin with a mantra followed by basic warm ups to open up the energy channels in our bodies before we get into the main kriya. The purpose of the kriya we will be performing is to harmonize the masculine and feminine polarity within the body which will result in the experience of a more wholesome, integrated and balanced sense of self. \r\n\r\n \r\nInstructor: Joel Mueller. Joel is an artist and musician with a deep interest in the spiritual and philosophical traditions of this world. For the past 7 years he has practiced a form of yoga called Kundalini tantra through the guidance of his partner Adriane. She learned this method from Yogi Bhajan and has been teaching it for over 15 years.","event_type":{"id":13,"label":"Other","abbr":"othr"},"year":2016,"print_description":"Kundalini tantra is designed to develop a greater awareness of the subtle energy in the body and strengthen the nervous system.","slug":"kundalini-tantra","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000001IDKPEA4","located_at_art":null,"other_location":"","check_location":1,"url":"http://www.cosmicopia.org/talks-and-workshops","all_day":0,"contact":"cosmicopia2@gmail.com","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-08-31T17:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2016-08-31T17:45:00-07:00"}]}],"timestamp":1575225235017}

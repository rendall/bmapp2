The viewer can choose to interact with the piece physically…or simply take the social cues and avoid the more interactive elements; this choice replicates the everyday choices we make in our social interactions, causing the viewer to rethink how they interpret the boundaries that are frequently crossed in our lives.","artist":"East Jesus","category":"Open Playa","program":null,"donation_link":null,"guided_tours":0,"self_guided_tour_map":0,"location":{"string":"3:15 2300'","hour":3,"minute":15,"distance":2300,"category":null,"gps_latitude":40.781399521198,"gps_longitude":-119.201432803615},"location_string":"3:15 2300'","images":[{"gallery_ref":74469,"thumbnail_url":"http://galleries.burningman.org/include/../filestore/tmp/api_resource_cache/74469_8fe92287b623757df9699089a5d52a39.jpg"}]},{"uid":"a2Id0000000UtrsEAC","year":2015,"name":"Wonder Whoasis","url":null,"contact_email":"wonderwhoasis@gmail.com","hometown":"Norwalk, CT","description":"Wonder Whoasis: Come put your \"heads in the clouds\", stop being grounded to reality & be free to imagine the unimaginable in a cloud out on the playa.

The house up close, is comprised of human souls that make up the mortar and stone. As the house crumbles, these spirits are set free. The piece conveys escape, release and regrowth. It's a visual essay on the theme of entrapment and freedom. As we travel through human life, we are broken down and destroyed.  This loss enables us to re-create ourselves so we can transform into different type of being. The wall is a bright green, patinaed by desert sun, and the figures will blossom out of the firmament to tell their own haunted stories.\r\n\r\nThe house is a place of security which is now lost.

Canvas sails hang from the serpent to catch the wind, causing the sculpture to swim gracefully through the air, and propane flames sprout from an array of outlets along its spine and jaws.","artist":null,"category":"Theme Art","program":"Honorarium","donation_link":null,"guided_tours":0,"self_guided_tour_map":0,"location":{"string":"8:55 1300'","hour":8,"minute":55,"distance":1300,"category":null,"gps_latitude":40.789128968419,"gps_longitude":-119.209524504029},"location_string":"8:55 1300'","images":[{"gallery_ref":0,"thumbnail_url":"https://embed.widencdn.net/img/burningman/y6p5euc3ua/640px/a2Id0000000UqHZEA0-1.jpeg?keep=c&crop=yes&u=r3rtjx"}]},{"uid":"a2Id0000000UrAUEA0","year":2015,"name":"Well of Darkness","url":"http://www.ironmonkeyarts.org/well-of-darkness.html","contact_email":"info@ironmonkeyarts.org","hometown":"Seattle, WA","description":"Courage, Temperance, Wisdom, Justice, Honor, Gratitude\r\n\r\nWell of Darkness is the third chapter in the mythology of The Guardian of Dawn.

They show you not just what you look like, but who you are and how you are as an animated, living human being! Backwards mirrors take all of our vitality away and present a flat and distorted version of ourselves.  The design of the Palace will be using Giant Tinker Toys.  Who knew you could build something big with them?   Inside will be a warm, softly lighted environment that offers a host of interactivity and a truly unique experience – magical even!  There's a lot of science involved too, you can read some of the posters available. A lot of this makes perfect sense for why it should be so different, and so much better.\r\nPrepare to see something surprising about yourself…you as a real, vibrant, and truly sparkling and happy human being. Or deep and genuine burner, with wisdom in your eyes.  Or whatever is true about you - your true image actually reflects all that information correctly, so you can continue to be true to yourself.  But be aware -  you have to “be it to see it”.  Don’t just stare at yourself - look in your eyes and interact! Ask questions about who you are, how you are, what’s going on. Look with a friend, eye to eye, smile, then look back as you see the real version of you.  Who is the person that we see, who do we know, who do we love? You may need to get past your initial sense of how unusual it is, and no, you are not as asymmetric as your perception can be telling you.  But then you can see something truly magical…the amazing burner that you really are!\r\nTo really make the point, look back to one of the backwards mirrors in the side panels, and notice how poorly mirrors reflect your true nature. Notice that the sparkle and light in your eyes just stops and you are staring, and more often than not, you become serious and doubtful.","artist":null,"category":"Theme Art","program":"Honorarium","donation_link":null,"guided_tours":0,"self_guided_tour_map":0,"location":{"string":"6:30 1800'","hour":6,"minute":30,"distance":1800,"category":null,"gps_latitude":40.783933539442,"gps_longitude":-119.212141732351},"location_string":"6:30 1800'","images":[{"gallery_ref":0,"thumbnail_url":"https://embed.widencdn.net/img/burningman/kzvoqkieca/640px/a2Id0000000UqEkEAK-1.jpeg?keep=c&crop=yes&u=r3rtjx"}]},{"uid":"a2Id0000000UspLEAS","year":2015,"name":"Mars Molecule","url":null,"contact_email":"onemars@yahoo.com","hometown":"San Francisco, CA","description":"These pieces playfully straddle in-between the mental and material realms resembling ancient artifacts of an advanced civilization with origins not necessarily earthly or human for that matter.

Weeks pass, slowly, a drop becomes a trickle, trickling, creeping, a journey begins, weaving, the trickle meanders. With time it grows, a small stream flows, filling the cracks of the playa. A sapling emerges, twisting and winding it grows high above the ground, encircling itself, entwining itself. A figure of our memories, a myriad of our existence, its infinitude transcends time and like the stream to the tree we breathe life into the playa.

It will start itching inside of you to be created in physical form, it's deepest desire is to be born out of the dream space. You came to Planet Earth to share this, now is your time. Calling all healers, conversation-starters, rebels, light-workers, and medicine women. This workshop is broken down into four magical sections. \r\n\r\n1) Connection. How relating to others is the number one function of your business or passion project. We begin the workshop with getting connected on the soul level to your fellow sisters.\r\n2) Reclaiming Your Unique Brilliance. Refining your message and creating something in the world that is unique, contributive, and that people will pay for. \r\n3) Healing Your Relationship With Money. Girl, if you want to start or expand your business, you've got to look at your drama and trauma with money. What would it be like if money flowed to you with ease? What would it be like if you could actually receive it? We will dive into this exploration together.\r\n4) Closing Ritual.

Come share your favorite tips and techniques by words and demonstration.  If you're still exploring getting comfortable, or are curious about details you never dared ask anyone, come share questions that have been plaguing you. . . . . . \r\n\r\n\t* How to protect yourself when the action gets intense? . . .\r\n\t* What about the gag reflex? . . .\r\n\t* Drool or dry?  . . .\r\n\t* How do you use hands and still go deep? . . .\r\n\r\nAnd guys, you must have comments you'd like to pass on, other than simply \"Yes, please\"! . . . . .\r\n\r\n\t* Hate teeth?  Want teeth? . . .\r\n\t* What about deep throat? . . .\r\n\r\nHere's your chance to make your requests - and pet peeves - heard! . . . . .\r\n\r\nThis is a participatory event open to couples of any combination, so long as one of them has some phallic protuberance and the other is applying lips, tongue, and maybe even throat to it.  No lookie-loos!  That said we also strongly welcome women still getting comfortable with giving oral pleasure, with or without a partner.  This is a really safe place to ask questions, in the group or in private conversation afterwards. . . . . .\r\n\r\nThis was a great fun event at previous Burns.

Mixing and matching every musical genre, era, and style into one big dance party, it's the soundtrack for the A.D.D. generation -- with free mashup CDs given away like candy!\r\n\r\nLaunched by DJ duo A Plus D in 2003 in San Francisco, Bootie was the first club night dedicated solely to the burgeoning artform of the bootleg mashup, and is now the biggest mashup event in the world, with regular parties in several cities on four continents. Bootie BRC is presented in part by the BRC Weekly, Black Rock City's independent newsweekly. \r\n\r\nBootie ... because one song at a time just isn't enough.","event_type":{"id":2,"label":"Gathering/Party","abbr":"prty"},"year":2015,"print_description":"OMG MUSIC WITH WORDS FOR 10 YEARS!

In brief: we choose a location, sit and write for ten minutes or so, share what we have written, and move on to another location. The only response we give to each others' writing is \"thank you.\" \r\nWe will likely depart from the Midway around 3:50 after we get ourselves organized and sit down to \"write out the cobwebs.\" Participate for as long as you wish.

Inside the Cocoon we physically create the space and structure with our bodies. Chanting, dancing and other ritualistic strategies will generate a massive collective energy. No experience necessary!  For the generally creative and outgoing. It manifests a collective spirit as we create a sacred space for transformation and rebirth. Inspiration, identity and rebirth take morphing, sculptural form. The Cocoon is a hand-crafted stretchy fabric enclosure created by Sherry Aliberti, an architect and performance artist based in New York City. Structurally, these postures represent a scale model of an architecture and materiality based on the forces of the body. The Cocoon Project is a multi-disciplinary collaborative performing the Cocoon with movers, live projected visuals and soundscape. The performed-installation conveys a primordial one-ness of many bodies within the sheer membrane. CocoonNYC performs site-specifically in galleries, music venues and alternative spaces. The Cocoon experience can be emotionally powerful for every age and/or background.","event_type":{"id":3,"label":"Class/Workshop","abbr":"work"},"year":2015,"print_description":"get inside, emerge rejuvenated!

In a move outside experts are hailing for its boldness and freshtasticness, False Profit, Inc., released news that it would be holding the event not at its desert research field campus proper, but “out in the open.”\r\n\r\n“For 14 years, we’ve invited shareholders to our desert campus to celebrate with us,” said Jef Pearlman, Senior VP of Auditory Logistics. “This year, we decided to think ‘outside the camp.’”\r\n\r\nCiting ever-increasing attendance, bicycle parking challenges, and the desire for attendees to experience high fidelity sound “en plein air” as forces pushing the party into the open playa, , a spokesperson for the company enthusiastically predicted that this year’s TNP would be “the best evar.”\r\n\r\nReferring to the unanticipated relocation, an unnamed insider also hinted that the main research facility is so filled this year with mad science projects--which shareholders will undoubtedly wish to keep a watchful eye on as conditions evolve--that the decision to shift was “easy peasy”.\r\n\r\nThe party will be held on the open “playa” approximately 300 feet out from the company’s primary campus location of 5:15 and Esplanade. This location was chosen due to the giant deep sea fish that will be located there, which analysts expect will protect attendees from wandering shirtcockers, newbs, darkwads, those rich people who are destroying Burning Man, and other unsavory characters. Known as Illumacanth, the fish will delight and astound party attendees with its spikes, lights, and fire. Sound for the event will be provided by the legendary Dr. Brainlove, a project of The Phage, a long-time affiliate company and co-conspirator of False Profit.","event_type":{"id":2,"label":"Gathering/Party","abbr":"prty"},"year":2015,"print_description":"It's Tuesday.

Each person, or group, is photographed in a studio setting and given an instant print as their tangible reminder of their Burning Man experience.  I then photograph then on medium format black and white film so that, if they wish, they can get prints at a later date.\r\n\r\nThese are not a re-do of your high school yearbook portrait just in Burning Man attire.  I try to give each person enough time to help me make a lasting photograph.  On our gallery walls in our shade structure there are black and white prints ranging in size from 16x20\" to 4x5' that I hope will be of some inspiration to you.  Though I try not to duplicate what I have done in the past they may serve as a jumping off point for our photography session.  Not the easiest thing given the approximately 47,000 black and white negatives done so far.  I have never counted and see no reason to start now.\r\n\r\nI consider the people I photograph as the most important part of any photograph and always try my best to make a photograph that will be of lasting value and interest well beyond the moment of its creation.\r\n\r\nCome, join me, and together we may make something wonderful.  \r\n\r\nI usually begin each day about 10 or 11 AM and continue into the night till I can't keep on my feet any longer.  Weather permitting I'll begin on Sunday August 30th through Saturday September 5th.\r\n\r\nI do look forward to photographing you.","event_type":{"id":2,"label":"Gathering/Party","abbr":"prty"},"year":2015,"print_description":"My 19th year making portraits of the participants.

It was one of those infinity pools that seems like it falls away to the surrounding landscapes. They got really trendy in the middle to late 90's and this one in particular had really nice cultured stone placed to look completely natural almost...\r\n\r\nA pool of robo-flection, falling away to nowhere...in this case it happened to be the gorgeous smog filled sky overlooking the 405 south and the 101. \r\n\r\n\"What have I become?\" he whispers to himself whispering back at himself.  \r\n\"Why am I wearing this amazing floral print burgundy kimono robe?\" which was actually made for him personally by one of the finest seamstresses in the Sai Kung district of Hong Kong. \r\n\r\nHe had been had by himself having been had. \r\n\r\nNo more. It was time to get back to what mattered most in Hotshot's life. I mean after all, no skeezer in all of Orange County could tighten his nuts half as much as The Burn had in the past. Just because he doesn't have feelings, doesn't mean he doesn't have feelings. \r\n\r\nThere is no shame in going.........home. \r\n\r\nHotshot immediately logged onto his brand new Macbook Pro with the 13.3\" HD Retina screen and made his first steps towards the playa and logged onto Stubhub and bought a ticket for $1175.00. After his friends said he couldn't fit his bean bag chair in their ride he went to ebay and purchased a car pass for $389 (free shipping) and folks the rest they say is history. \r\n\r\nCome say hello old friends and new friends alike. 3:00 plaza all week, only God knows when.","event_type":{"id":1,"label":"Ritual/Ceremony","abbr":"cere"},"year":2015,"print_description":"Hotshot the Robot returns to celebrate the 10th anniversary of his 1st birthday.

I purposely set up at the remotest spot I can find, away from camps, sound systems, art vehicles and crowds.  Trying to provide a service to intrepid playa explorers, people out riding bikes along the trash fence, those reaching beyond the EDM to see the desert vastness.

You’re having a wonderful conversation and you feel the excitement building in your chest.  You’re at the point where you know you want to take it to the next level. It’s the moment of no return. This moment of tension is both one of the hottest moments of attraction and potentially one of the most awkward.  \r\n\r\nHow do you know if the other person is at the same desire level? How do you assess their openness to touch, to a kiss, or more? A kiss or initial touch is relatively low stakes, but what happens when things heat up? What happens when you’ve just overstepped a line and can feel their withdrawal?  \r\n\r\nThese nuanced moments of initial sexual attraction can be the hottest of our lives. But we’re never really taught how to navigate highly sexually charged moments with someone completely new.  What does it mean to fully take responsibility for these moments so that when we’re done everyone involved feels totally awesome?   \r\n\r\nIn this workshop you will get a much deeper understanding of the nuances of initiating and negotiating hot and sexy connections. \r\n\r\n-Boost your sexual self-confidence\r\n-Know how to feel your “fuck yes!” and your “Oh no!” and everything in between.\r\n-Understand when and how to bring up \"the conversation\" so you don’t deflate all the sexual turn-on!\r\n-Gain clear sexy communication skills to keep it hot while still conveying important information.\r\n-And learn the number 1 reason why these skills will make you the sexiest person on earth!","event_type":{"id":3,"label":"Class/Workshop","abbr":"work"},"year":2015,"print_description":"Meriana will share tools on navigating altered states of consciousness & Aya which will enrich your psychonautic tool kit & empower your inner shaman.","slug":"navigating-altered-states-ayahuasca","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000000N5QQEA0","located_at_art":null,"other_location":"","check_location":0,"url":"http://www.merianadinkova.com/","all_day":0,"contact":"merianadinkova@gmail.com","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2015-09-03T16:45:00-07:00","end_time":"2015-09-03T18:15:00-07:00"}]},{"event_id":14063,"title":"Need a penny?

The dungeon is well equipped with 3 St Andrews Crosses, a seated cross, 2 benches, a kneeling spanking/flogging bench, a standing spanking/flogging bench, a suspension station, 2 padded saw horses, a standing/kneeling stock, an 8' chain spider web, and a petting cage. We offer several toys to come and experience and play with such as feathers, a variety of floggers, paddles, crops, pinwheels, fur gloves, and a violet wand. Our personnel are available to provide instruction and demonstration on the safe use of the equipment and will supervise all play. We also have a lounge area where you can relax and meet our campmates while checking out our camp. The lounge has a spanking bike, a corn hole bean bag game, lounge chairs, a mini bar serving our cherry bombs for those over 21 years old with id, as well as, a spinning wheel to facilitate participation.  There are also daily scheduled classes with demonstrations and audience participation. We'll have an Intro Into Dungeon Play and a Shibari Sexy Body Rope Tying classes.

Or Neither. \r\n\r\nSeveral Riders PEDAL AND DRIVE head-to-head around a 60 x 90 foot track under the gorgeous CIRCUS TENT with LIGHTS, MUSIC and ANNOUNCERS! Our BUMPER CARTS are custom designed and one-of a kind! It's like driving your own personal pedal powered art car for 3 minutes or however long you last. The TENT is a SHADY OASIS in the DAY and a LIT-UP BEACON of fun at NIGHT!\r\n\r\n Winners of each race are determined by a mysterious mix of whatever the announcers at the time deem worthy. Is it the number of rear end or T-bone collisions you make happen? or maybe how many crashes you nimbly avoid with expert driving skills. Or maybe your winning attitude. Or your crazy costume. Maybe you cross the finish line first. Maybe you cross it last or not at all. You might still be a WINNER. We're betting on it! KIDS tall enough to pedal are welcome. Adults of ALL AGES brave or timid welcome. ALL Spectators welcome too! Come into the center ring and heckle your friends in the races!\r\n\r\nPEDALING is FUN but BUMPING is EVEN BETTER! Seriously, the bumpers keep you safe and you will laugh your ass off with every bump, crash, skid or pass. \r\n\r\nWe also welcome volunteers who want to help with PIT CREW duties! Wrangle the crowds, heckle the riders, keep the pedal carts repaired.

We work with 12 pinhole cameras, created out of 50-gallon cardboard barrels. This size is uniquely suited for capturing the incredible scale and immense diversity of art and culture at Black Rock City. \r\n\r\nUnder the red safelights of the darkroom, photosensitive paper is inserted into the camera body. Exposures range from 40 to 300 seconds, where concentrated beams of sunlight are funnelled through the pinhole and into the camera, creating a negative image of the recorded subject.\r\n\r\nWe maintain a desert darkroom in a shipping container, where we gather to processes, develop and fix about one hundred photographs each Burning Man. These unique images are then exhibited in Illumination Village, Center Camp Cafe, and off-playa.\r\n\r\nThe pinhole camp has been creating large-scale portraits with festival participants since 1999. The pinhole came about of the desire of four first time participants to contribute in a unique and lasting way to the ephemeral pleasures of the playa.\r\n\r\nAs we have grown, so too has our belief that this device is the reason that we make our annual pilgrimage. As we have evolved, so too has the camera, not only in functional and technical capabilities but also in its role as a seed of meaningful engagement with other participants.","event_type":{"id":2,"label":"Gathering/Party","abbr":"prty"},"year":2015,"print_description":"Come and join the Pinhole Project expose huge 30 x 40 inch sheets of light sensitive gelatin silver paper in 50 gallon cameras.","slug":"pinhole-project","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000000N5QBEA0","located_at_art":null,"other_location":"Pinhole Project in Illumination Village","check_location":0,"url":"http://www.pinholeproject.org/","all_day":0,"contact":"cawhelan@att.net","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2015-08-31T10:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2015-08-31T12:00:00-07:00"},{"start_time":"2015-09-02T10:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2015-09-02T12:00:00-07:00"},{"start_time":"2015-09-04T10:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2015-09-04T12:00:00-07:00"}]},{"event_id":13914,"title":"Pink Floyd-Pretty Playa Lights","uid":"qhrtTM9Xa32Jm36y9DhL","description":"Come and take advantage of Club Neu Verbotens hospitality and Playa view for a Pink Floyd Pillow Party All new Mobile Fidelity mix.","event_type":{"id":2,"label":"Gathering/Party","abbr":"prty"},"year":2015,"print_description":"Come and take advantage of Club Neu Verbotens hospitality and Playa view for a Pink Floyd Pillow Party All new Mobile Fidelity mix.","slug":"pink-floyd-pretty-playa-lights","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000000MwG7EAK","located_at_art":null,"other_location":"clubneuverboten","check_location":0,"url":"","all_day":0,"occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2015-09-01T23:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2015-09-02T01:30:00-07:00"}]},{"event_id":15969,"title":"Pink Floyd-Pretty Playa Lights","uid":"uX6FiZkozgxdG4vjBCfo","description":"Come and take advantage of Club Neu Verboten’s hospitality and perfect location for a Pink Floyd pillow party with a view.

Maybe it was a branch of a tree with a piece of tinsel wrapped around it? Possibly you’ve been mesmerized by one of those floating jellyfish on Burn Night?\r\n\r\nWell – if the jellyfish is your thing then you probably need to come back for the advanced class next year. But random objects hanging from sticks covered in lights and glittery things… that’s totally our thing! That, my friend, is what we call a “raving stick” and no self-respecting raver should venture out onto the playa at night without one.\r\n\r\nCome for an interactive, playa punch-infused lesson in the art of raving stick making, featuring group discussions and plenty of one on one time with our experienced teachers. We’ll round off the afternoon with a delightful presentation on the history of the raving stick - you simply won’t believe some of the famous names you’ll hear!\r\n\r\nRaving stick materials will be provided on the day by Celtic Chaos, but attendees are more than welcome to bring along their own personal additions. And the best part is that each person gets to leave with the raving stick that they make... but not until they partake in a collective stick-shaking rave-off inside The Castle!","event_type":{"id":3,"label":"Class/Workshop","abbr":"work"},"year":2015,"print_description":"Raving stick: the art of hanging colorful objects on a stick and proceeding to rave.

It's like driving your own personal pedal powered art car for 3 minutes or however long you last. The TENT is a SHADY OASIS in the DAY and a LIT-UP BEACON of fun at NIGHT! Winners of each race are determined by a mysterious mix of whatever the announcers at the time deem worthy. Is it the number of rear end or T-bone collisions you make happen? or maybe how many crashes you nimbly avoid with expert driving skills. Or maybe your winning attitude. Or your crazy costume. Maybe you cross the finish line first. Maybe you cross it last or not at all. You might still be a WINNER. We're betting on it! KIDS tall enough to pedal are welcome. Adults of ALL AGES brave or timid welcome. ALL Spectators welcome too! Come into the center ring and heckle your friends in the races! PEDALING is FUN but BUMPING is EVEN BETTER! Seriously, the bumpers keep you safe and you will laugh your ass off with every bump, crash, skid or pass. We also welcome volunteers who want to help with PIT CREW duties! Wrangle the crowds, heckle the riders, keep the pedal carts repaired. Sign up for our newsletter on our FB page or just stop by anytime we are live on Playa!

This process will be facilitated with some simple relating exercises and is a chance to see through our ego and conditioned habitual ways of relating and being. We invite a sense of humor to simply seeing ourselves and the conscious and unconscious games we play. \r\nBringing awareness to our patterns opens the possibility of playing with them and responding from our clear deep heart mind space, rather than reacting.

As a Rootist, we take the roots of various truths and incorporate them into our own mantra, our own way of living, to become the well rounded person that we wish to be. When you resonate with more than one truth, you are a Rootist. There are many different types of Rootist's. You could be a Christian Rootist, a Buddhist Rootist, or any type of Rootist. The moment you resonate with more than one truth & take the roots of those teachings as your truths, you become a Rootist.\r\n\r\nRootism is a lesson that I have learned and come to resonate with over the last few years. I am grateful to share this information with each of you. Please feel free to share this with anyone with whom you feel might be interested.\r\n\r\nAs an offset of Rootism, we have The Rootist's Way. A style of yoga that is in-tentful in it's design and sequences to help to facilitate a certain type of energy clearing and calling in of new energies.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this and for wanting to know more about Rootism.\r\n\r\nThe 8 Principles of Rootism:\r\n\r\n∞Principles of Rootism™\r\n\r\n1. Release what no longer serves - nurture yourself & ground yourself\r\n2. Embrace a Creative Vision\r\n3. Move forward on your journey -Take Steps Fearlessly\r\n4. Empathize and Feel what is going on within you & others\r\n5. Motivate yourself & others by Truth – Check the Ecology of the Whole\r\n6. Bridge the Mind & the Heart\r\n7. Evolve a Pro-Sociality Lifestyle & Manifest a Greater Humanity - help others and give back\r\n8. Revolutionize - Reveal Yourself! Open UP! Inner Knowing is Outer Showing\r\n\r\nThe acronym is \"Remember\"","event_type":{"id":3,"label":"Class/Workshop","abbr":"work"},"year":2015,"print_description":"Rootism is a belief that the truth of our learned existence lies in the Roots of all teachings/truths and beliefs.","slug":"rootist-yoga-practice","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000000MwBuEAK","located_at_art":null,"other_location":"","check_location":0,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1064111576949002/","all_day":0,"occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2015-09-01T15:30:00-07:00","end_time":"2015-09-01T16:45:00-07:00"},{"start_time":"2015-09-03T15:30:00-07:00","end_time":"2015-09-03T16:45:00-07:00"}]},{"event_id":16425,"title":"Root the Body, Release Ego, Ignite Power","uid":"QsQudsKsWRudgLPaSEJU","description":"Gift yourself the opportunity to flow through Burning Man from a place of groundedness, liberation and power.

Either you will love our snow cones or you will love our camp members who are yogis, meditators, musicians, Japanese bondage-rope artists, DJs and historians.","event_type":{"id":5,"label":"Food","abbr":"food"},"year":2015,"print_description":"Come, come, come for a tasty treat of love and zeal for new friendship while supplies last.","slug":"siberian-snowcones-w-cyberia","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000000N2rDEAS","located_at_art":null,"other_location":"TBA","check_location":0,"url":"http://campcyberia.org/","all_day":0,"contact":"campcyberia@gmail.com","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2015-08-31T14:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2015-08-31T16:00:00-07:00"},{"start_time":"2015-09-01T14:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2015-09-01T16:00:00-07:00"},{"start_time":"2015-09-02T14:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2015-09-02T16:00:00-07:00"},{"start_time":"2015-09-03T14:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2015-09-03T16:00:00-07:00"},{"start_time":"2015-09-04T14:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2015-09-04T16:00:00-07:00"},{"start_time":"2015-09-05T14:00:00-07:00","end_time":"2015-09-05T16:00:00-07:00"}]},{"event_id":15727,"title":"SIDESHOW's Big Show","uid":"7zFFaW6bT6DCu6iU7ByQ","description":"You're just in time!

You’re having a wonderful conversation and you feel the excitement building in your chest.  You’re at the point where you know you want to take it to the next level. It’s the moment of no return. This moment of tension is both one of the hottest moments of attraction and potentially one of the most awkward.  \r\n\r\nHow do you know if the other person is at the same desire level? How do you assess their openness to touch, to a kiss, or more? A kiss or initial touch is relatively low stakes, but what happens when things heat up? What happens when you’ve just overstepped a line and can feel their withdrawal?  \r\n\r\nThese nuanced moments of initial sexual attraction can be the hottest of our lives. But we’re never really taught how to navigate highly sexually charged moments with someone completely new.  What does it mean to fully take responsibility for these moments so that when we’re done everyone involved feels totally awesome?   \r\n\r\nIn this workshop you will get a much deeper understanding of the nuances of initiating and negotiating hot and sexy connections. \r\n\r\n-Boost your sexual self-confidence\r\n-Know how to feel your “fuck yes!” and your “Oh no!” and everything in between.\r\n-Understand when and how to bring up \"the conversation\" so you don’t deflate all the sexual turn-on!\r\n-Gain clear sexy communication skills to keep it hot while still conveying important information.\r\n-And learn the number 1 reason why these skills will make you the sexiest person on earth!","event_type":{"id":3,"label":"Class/Workshop","abbr":"work"},"year":2015,"print_description":"Navigating New Sexy Connections: From “Fuck Yes!” To “Oh No!” and all those \"Maybes\" In Between!

Are you interested in creating real safe spaces for people whether they fit in the binary or not? Are you troubled by cultural appropriation on playa and the way some folks are treated as other or freaks in a way that doesn't feel good? Then this workshop is for you. This workshop is also for you if you want to delve into the intersections of race, gender, class and how these identities affect our experience at BM and beyond. Many of us come to playa to be free and our full liberated selves yet when we pass through the gate we have not dropped our baggage of racism, transphobia, sexism, abelism, and classism at the gate.  So let's be real and talk about how these isms affect our time on playa and off and what we want to do to create the world we want to live in.

Volunteers provide peer-to-peer harm reduction support for individuals having a difficult drug-related experience and who don't require medical care. Guests are sometimes actively on substance, and other times are seeking integration support, or education about the risks involved in drug use. We staff the space 24/7 with trained mental health and medical professionals who provide oversight, as well as individuals experienced in crisis response.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to come to the training to learn more about volunteering, it will take place at Something Freaky This Way Foams, near 2:00&G, on Tuesday September 1 at 11AM. \r\n\r\nThe four principles of psychedelic harm reduction include: \r\n\r\n1. Create a safe space - If someone is having a challenging experience try to move them into a comfortable, warm, and calm environment. If possible, try to avoid noisy or crowded spaces. Ask what would make them most comfortable. Offer blankets and water. \r\n\r\n2. Sitting, not guiding - Be a calm presence of acceptance, compassion, and caring. Promote feelings of trust and security. Let the person's unfolding experience be the guide. Don't try to get ahead of their process. Explore distressing issues if they want, but know that simply being with the person is supportive and talking may not be helpful.\r\n\r\n3. Talk through, not down - Invite the person to explore what's happening and encourage them to try not to resist it. Remind them that they are safe. \r\n\r\n4. Difficult is not the same as bad - challenging experiences can wind up being our most valuable and lead to learning and growth. Help the person integrate the experience, and remind them the experience will continue to unfold.","event_type":{"id":8,"label":"Care/Support","abbr":"care"},"year":2015,"print_description":"Feeling out of sorts?

We will help you picture the perfect day 10 yrs in your future. The process works by subconsciously shifting your decision making over the next 10 years eventually making your vision a reality. You don't know what that day looks like? Don't worry, most people don't, but your subconscious already knows what is important to it. The more amazing and compelling the vision that you let emerge, the more you will be drawn to it. How? Most people make between 80 to 400 decisions a day. A rich, compelling visualization with a lot of sensory \"hooks\" can shift those decisions towards your perfect future because the right choices will feel \"right\". We will start with a mindfulness of breath meditation, a gratitude exercise and then wake up the morning of your perfect day and explore it through a guided process. After, we will ask a few of those interested to share their visualization with the group. We look forward to sharing your future day together.

Emily is the hero of the story, a character very much a literary stand-in for author and performer Eleanor O’Brien. We meet her as a child, fascinated by romance novels and her father’s porn. The show traces her journey from awkward teen to college boyfriends, complete with disappointing first times and disastrous blowjobs. But then she discovers renown sex-columnist Dan Savage, her ‘gay fairy godfather’. Dan helps her learn to ask for what she wants (“I can touch my own clit during sex?”), and encourages her to be GGG (Good, Giving and Game). Emily goes on a spree of experimentation, culminating in the “grand prix of getting lucky,” Burning Man. At the world’s largest alternative event, she meets Matt, who turns out to be the love of her life-but he doesn’t identify as monogamous. Can they make it work? Emily asks Dan for advice as they navigate the thrills and valleys of opening the relationship: how to negotiate boundaries, deal with jealousy and keep from falling in love with other people. She thinks if they follow the rules they've set, they can keep their relationship safe. They can be “monogamish,” and keep the spark in their marriage. When a magical threesome drives her to utter meltdown, Emily insists on closing their marriage. But monogamy doesn’t solve all their problems. Emily and Matt discover they have different libidos - and the seven-year itch isn’t a myth. He encourages her to spread her wings, so she takes a lover. All's fine for a while, but soon she finds herself falling in love with Michael, her NSA partner for play. She is terrified of losing her marriage to Matt, and asks Dan again for advice. “Is polyamory a utopian ideal?” During an ayahuasca ceremony, Emily finally sees where she's been blind to how her behavior has stifled her marriage, and how she has to let go of the need for certainty, or controlling anyone else’s heart.","event_type":{"id":7,"label":"Performance","abbr":"perf"},"year":2015,"print_description":"This one woman play by Eleanor O'Brien of Dance Naked Prod. received critical acclaim at this year's Canadian Fringe Festival. 75 minute running time","slug":"lust-marriage-a-womans-journey-into-polyamory","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000000N8OdEAK","located_at_art":null,"other_location":"PlayDome at Playa 4 Play at 4-G","check_location":1,"url":"","all_day":0,"contact":"gabriella@sexpositiveworld.org","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2015-09-01T21:15:00-07:00","end_time":"2015-09-01T22:30:00-07:00"},{"start_time":"2015-09-02T21:15:00-07:00","end_time":"2015-09-02T22:30:00-07:00"},{"start_time":"2015-09-03T21:15:00-07:00","end_time":"2015-09-03T22:30:00-07:00"},{"start_time":"2015-09-04T21:15:00-07:00","end_time":"2015-09-04T22:30:00-07:00"},{"start_time":"2015-09-05T21:15:00-07:00","end_time":"2015-09-05T22:30:00-07:00"}]},{"event_id":14912,"title":"Rope Harnesses, Dresses, Bondage: Oh my!","uid":"fYbf4tFXfNr5cvuSjza5","description":"Learn how to create a custom harness and saunter off wearing one of your very own.
